# Logistic Regression for Differential Expression
This github repo contains the code for reproducing the analysis and figures in Ntranos et al., 2018. Parts of the analysis were performed in python and others in R.

## Getting Started
For tutorials on using logistic regression for CD45, one can use 10x_example-logR.  For the simulations and analysis in R, simulations/RSEM/R provides the R code for performing logistic regression. Snakefile is also a workflow that one can use for regenerate the simulations and rerun the analysis.
