# Logistic Regression for Differential Expression
This GitHub repository contains the code for reproducing the analysis and figures in [Ntranos, Yi et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0303-9). Parts of the analysis were performed in python and others in R.

## Getting Started
For tutorials on using logistic regression for CD45, one can use 10x_example-logR.  For the simulations and analysis in R, simulations/RSEM/R provides the R code for performing logistic regression. The snakefile is also a workflow that can be used to regenerate the simulations and rerun the analysis.
